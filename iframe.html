                This means that He has always existed.  God does not have a beginning.  Before anything else  existed,  there  was  only  God.    God  is  all-powerful.  That means that God can do anything.  There is nothing that God does not have the power to do.

                St. Francis of Assisi

            <p class="page7_three">
                St. Francis was born in 1181 in the town of Assisi in Italy.  When he was young, he wanted to be a knight.  But Francis heard God calling him to something greater.  He fell in love with God and  wanted  to follow  Him  with  all  his  heart.  Francis started the religious group known as the  Franciscans.    Francis  loved  all  of  God’s creation.    He  saw  God’s  beauty  and  love  in everything He had made.  More than anything, Francis wanted to be holy and to please God.  He died  in 1226.   St. Francis of  Assisi’s feast day is October 4.
